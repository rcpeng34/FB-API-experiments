<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>The app doesn't work!</h3>
<p>That's unfortunate. Please refresh the page.</p>

<h3>I definitely have more photos/statuses than that! My most common word isn't "yolo" >:(</h3>
<p>Meh Facebook Stats makes a request for data every time you use the application. Since we
dont' store your data, we're limited to what we receive in response to our request</p>

<h3>Take down that embarrassing photo of me!</h3>
<p>We don't store any of this data, we're just displaying all photos we receive from the API with location data to you.
If there is a private photo that is viewable only to you on facebook but still provided by the API, rest assured that once you close this browser, no data is stored. However when you come back and visit us, we'll make the same request for data and display all the data that the API service provides us. However if someone else visits us, we'll only display images that user has access on Facebook to.</p>
